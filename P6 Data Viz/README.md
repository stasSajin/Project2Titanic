Ok, so this graph shows that Prosper is likely over-estimating the returns on the loans. This is interesting and very informative. The information is also very easy to grasp, since the difference between realized and actual returns is so large. What I find interesting is that Prosper got better at estimating their returns and that towards the end of the 2014, the realized and estimated returns converge.

One question that I have is why is there a dip in realized returns towards the end?

Some suggestion for improving the plot would be to include an introductory paragraph and a summary paragraph at the end. Also, I would suggest to make the title of the axes larger and to clean up the ticks.

(I talked with this reviewer more and we decided after this to present the loans only up until the November of 2013. The dip in realized returns towards the end of the graph appears because there are only very few loans that have matured during that period (either because of pre-payments or because of defaults). Since the loans were just issued, their status is not yet completed (in other words the loan is still current; it can achieve a completed status if it was fully repaid, defaulted, or charged-off)

This graph indicates that one should be wary of the promises Prosper makes in regard to the loans they are under-writing. The line plot is very easy to process and understand. I also appreciate the interactivity present in the plot. Here are some issues that need to be fixed:

* The x-axis title needs to be lager
* The ticks for the x-axis need to be changed (right now they are overlapping)
* It would be useful to include a description as to what estimated and realized returns are
* A summary with the main points should be included at the end, where the message is clearly conveyed to the user.

This graphs helps explain a lot of questions as to why I was never achieving the promised returns on my diversified loan portfolio through prosper. It clearly shows that investors are over-promised in regard to the expected return and the actual return is much lower. 

What is the issue with the dip in realized returns? Is it because there are only a few loans for that period? Also, why is there no info present for the more recent loans?

I suggest you fix the axis and include a summary for the plot, so that the main take-a-way is easily available.
